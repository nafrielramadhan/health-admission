**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict health outcomes for patients admitted to a hospital based on various factors such as demographics, medical conditions, lab results, and duration of stay. The dataset includes detailed information about patient admission, diagnosis, and health status during their stay, which can be used to predict future patient outcomes, such as discharge or medical complications.

The project is part of my final assignment for the "Introduction to AI & Data Science" course at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia.
